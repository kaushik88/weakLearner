1. **Single Point of Contact** - Sometimes it might be tempted to assign a task to 2 people and have them equally responsible (maybe you're afraid to make 1 of them the lead). This makes it significantly hard for them to agree on things, make decisions and eventually move faster.

2. **Emotional Rollercoaster** - In a single day/week, you'll go from feeling awesome about working on latest technologies to feeling completely ruined from a career point of view and back again. Will the startup be profitable, will the code work, how can you scale this across clients, are your co-workers leaving etc. [From @pmarcas book]

3. **Colleagues** - You'll have lots of discussions and arguments with your colleagues and its best to not take any of this personal. At the same time, you'll have lots of fun conversations and you'll get to know them better.
