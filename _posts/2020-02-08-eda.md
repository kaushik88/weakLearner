### Overview

1. EDA consists of four simple but powerful operations: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, and
random deletion.
2. Training with EDA while using only 50% of the available training set achieved the same accuracy as normal
training with all available data.

### Architecture

1. Synonym Replacement (SR): Randomly choose *n* words from the sentence that are not stop words. Replace each of these words with one of its synonyms chosen at random.
2. Random Insertion (RI): Find a random synonym of a random word in the sentence that is not a stop word. Insert that synonym into a random position in the sentence. Do this *n* times.
3. Random Swap (RS): Randomly choose two words in the sentence and swap their positions. Do this *n* times.
4. Random Deletion (RD): Randomly remove each word in the sentence with probability *p*.
