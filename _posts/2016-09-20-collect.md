1. How to combine both *map* and *filter* into a single function.

Please read [this]() post on Maps and Filters before continuing.

A common pattern in Scala is to filter items and then transforming (map) the filtered items. If you think about it, this is 2 iterations over the collection. Definitely, it can be optimized into a single iteration using the *Collect* method. Consider this example - 

val numbers : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

val squareNumbers = numbers.map{case number :Int => number * number}

val oddSquareNumbers = numbers.filter{case number => number %2 == 1}.map{case number => number * number}
val oddSquareNumbers = numbers.collect{case number if number %2 == 1 => number * number} // Better
