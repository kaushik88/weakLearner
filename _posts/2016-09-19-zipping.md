In this blog post, you'll learn about 

1. How to merge the values of 2 collections (list, array, buffer etc).

**Zip**

If you want to merge the values of 2 collections so that they can be processed together, here's how you might do it in Java - 

{% gist kaushik88/b699f9e5abbe3f596ec72ec2da983464 java-declare.java %}

// Now, if I know that the keys and values are of the same length and are in order, I might want to process them together.

{% gist kaushik88/b699f9e5abbe3f596ec72ec2da983464 java-zip.java %}

However, the following operation can be easily done in Scala using the **zip** operation.

{% gist kaushik88/b699f9e5abbe3f596ec72ec2da983464 zip.scala %}

**ZipWithIndex**

An extension of the **zip** operation is the *zipWithIndex*. The function of this is self-explanatory.
