In this blog post, you'll learn about 

1. How to merge the values of 2 collections (list, array, buffer etc).

**Zip**

If you want to merge the values of 2 collections so that they can be processed together, here's how you might do it in Java - 

List[Integer] keys = new ArrayList[Integer];
List[String] values = new ArrayList[Integer];
Map[Integer, String] keyValueMap = new HashMap[Integer, String];

// Now, if I know that the keys and values are of the same length and are in order, I might want to process them together.

for(int i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
	Integer key = keys.get(i);
	String value = values.get(i);

	// Process (key and value) and maybe create a Map.
	keyValueMap.put(key, value);
}

However, the following operation can be easily done in Scala using the **zip** operation.

val keys = List(1,2,3)
val values = List("value1", "value2", "value3")

keys.zip(values).toMap
keys.zip(values).map{case (key,value) => // process key and value} // This also works.

**ZipWithIndex**

An extension of the **zip** operation is the *zipWithIndex*. The function of this is self-explanatory.

val records = List(("Kaushik", 27, "Mountain View"), ("Michael", 31, "Palo Alto"))
val dbEntry = records
				.zipWithIndex
				.map{case ((name,age,location), index) => (index+1, name, age, location)}

// dbEntry = List((1,"Kaushik",27,"Mountain View"), (2,"Michael",31,"Palo Alto"))
