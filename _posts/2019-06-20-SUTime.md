**Detecting Temporal Expressions**

There are 2 steps for extracting time from natural language expressions - 

1. Detecting temporal expressions.
2. Extracting normalized time expressions from natural language phrases. 

This paper is about the latter. They use [TIMEX](http://www.timeml.org/publications/specs.html) representation of time expression.

**Types of Temporal Expressions**

There are 4 types of temporal expressions - 

1. Time - A time point indicating a particular instance on a time scale. Examples include Nov 20 1988, 5:30 PM, now, next weekend or Sunday Evening.

2. Duration - The amount of intervening time between the two end-points of a time interval. Examples include 5 days, 10 months, a decade, few years or 2-3 months.

3. Interval - A range of time defined by a start and end time points. Examples include Jan 2021 to Feb 2022.

4. Set - A set of temporals. Examples include "every 3rd Sunday".

**Datasets and Evaluation**

- A popular dataset is [TempEval-2](http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/). SUTime had the best Recall and F1 on this dataset but HeidelTime had the best precision. They've incorporated the work into Stanford CoreNLP.
