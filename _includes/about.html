      I am an early engineer at Passage AI - a conversational AI startup in Mountain View, CA. I am working on Dialog and Natural Language Understanding and I believe there will be a conversational interface to every system in the future. I've over 8 years of experience building AI driven products for companies like Google, LinkedIn and Microsoft. Prior to that I received my Masters in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology at Atlanta specializing in Machine Learning.
